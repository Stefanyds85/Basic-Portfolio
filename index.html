    <p>
      Hello there!! My name is Stefany and I’d Like to thank you for take the time to visit my site. You are currently viewing
      and experiencing my very first website portfolio. As you may have notices, there are still some kinks to be worked
      out, but I look forward to sharing my progress with you through the next 6 months during this codding boot camp. Yes,
      you heard correct, I’ve been learning to code! How did that come about you ask? Well, it all stemmed from me wanting
      to change things up career wise. Once the opportunity presented itself, I jumped at the idea of exploring something
      new in a field where I would have the ability to be creative and diverse in my job function. Thanks again for stopping
      by and I hope you come back soon to check out the transformation of my site in the upcoming months.
    </p>
